This is my lab5 demo YouTube link: https://youtu.be/dElikcrsUW0

On my circuit breadboard, the external Red Led is connected to Pin 15, and the external Green LED is connected to Pin 32. First, I initialize and make sure the correct I2C bus address and calibrate accelerometer by considering offset settings. Now, ESP32 can read the accelerometer values of X, Y, and Z from ADXL343. Second, I setup two IFTTT Applets. For Applet 1, I set Google Assistant as a trigger by saying "Motion sensor activate/deactivate", and set Webhooks as an action with an URL of ThingSpeak Write API Key. For Applet 2, I set a Webhooks as a trigger with an Event Name, "Motion_Detected", and set Notifications as an action by formatting message with Event Name, Occur time, and values of Accel X, Accel Y, and Accel Z. Now, once I give a voice command to Google Assistant, it is able to send data to ThingSpeak. In order to read activation from ThingSpeak, ESP32 will read the newest string value from json file in ThingSpeak to determine whether the system can detect motions. This is done every 30 second by using a hardware timer. If the system is activated, the green led will light up and the detect_motion function will be executed to start detect motions. If any motion is detected, the red led will light up and the system will post a web request to Webhooks by using the Webhooks Key. If no motion, the red led will not light up. After Webhooks is triggered, the system will send notifications from IFTTT. If the system is deactivated, the green led will not light up. The system will not detect anything even there is motion, and red led will never light up.
